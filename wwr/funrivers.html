      <p>Highlights from the past season...</p>

        <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. 
        This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. 
        We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. The season started off with some chilly weather in the early 
        season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures).
        Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. 
        We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.
