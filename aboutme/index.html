    <h2>Marco Quintero</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone, I'm Marco Quintero and I am from Colombia but grew up in the Bahamas. I live in Palm Beach,
        Florida and my beautiful wife is Colombian as well but she is living in Montreal, Canada.</p>
    <p>I was baptized in the Bahamas and have loved the gospel since. I brought my wife into the church and she was
        baptized last year in Montreal. She loves it and we are so happy to be members of the church but most
        importantly the love we have for our Savior.</p>
    <p>I'm persuing a career as a iOS developer but I just made that decision a few weeks ago. I have studied Python,
        JavaScript and Swift for the last few weeks and though I'm not great, I love learning this new material.</p>
    <p>I enjoy sports but soccer and martial arts(NIn-Jutsu) are my second religion. I came playing soccer
        professionally to the US
        and martial arts are plainly awesome. Crossfit and weightlifting are great too. I love painting, drawing,
        pyrography, sculpting and playing various musical instruments.</p>
    <p> I love to be part of BYU and I wish everyone an amazing semester. Hope you do well in everyhthing!</p>
    <h2>BYU Rocks!</h2>
